Coding challenge similar to Conway's Game of Life

I once took a coding challenge as a part of a job interview. The description of the challenge is very similar to Conway's Game of Life. For the challeng, I chose to code it in C. It was originally written at CoderPad (https://app.coderpad.io/sandbox), then ported over to Xcode and built for macOS Monterey.

The size of the table used to be adjusted as necessary, but starts as an array of 9x9 square.

There are also several debug settings that can be toggled by commenting in the #define statements.

This repo contains the final results.

Enjoy!
